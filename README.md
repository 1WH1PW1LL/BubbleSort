# BubbleSort
Need to sort out ten integers from least to greatest? We've got your back.

## Description
Asks the user for 10 integer inputs. Uses 10 if conditionals in one for-loop that runs 10 times to sort. Prints the outputs in least to greatest order.
When changing variable values make sure to create and utilize a storage variable so that none of the data values get lost.   
Example Code:    
int var1;     
int var2;     
var1 = storage;     
var1 = var2;          
var2 = storage;
